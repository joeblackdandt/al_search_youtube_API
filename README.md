# About
This is a very small project that uses the YouTube API to retrieve search results and load them into a youtube iframe. The purpose is to learn in a simple way how to interact with APIs.

Using OAUTH you can query YouTube for results based on the logged user and the query parameters.

**Pretty good, isnt it?**
